# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-DL

Breast cancer is a major cause of death among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can increase the chances of survival. In this project, I have built a predictive system to classify whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using deep learning. 
I have used a simple neural network model for the classification task. The model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with a ReLU activation function, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. I have used binary cross-entropy as the loss function and optimized the model using stochastic gradient descent. 
To evaluate the performance of the model, I have used the argmax function to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the output of the sigmoid function. I have also plotted the model accuracy and loss using matplotlib to visualize the training process and identify potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting.
To train the model, I have used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains 569 samples of fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast mass. The dataset includes 30 features that are computed from the images, such as radius, texture, and perimeter.
Overall, this project demonstrates how a simple neural network can be used to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign with high accuracy. The model can potentially be used as a tool to assist medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
